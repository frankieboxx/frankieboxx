# 👋 Hi there! Welcome to my playful corner of GitHub!

I'm the manager of the Centre of Advanced Academic Studies in Dubrovnik, where curiosity and creativity set sail every day.  
When I'm not steering the academic ship, you’ll find me coding with:

- 🟦 **SQL**
- 🟩 **C#**
- 🟨 **JavaScript**
- 🟦 **TypeScript**

## 🤖 Favorite Co-pilots

- GitHub Copilot (my coding first mate)
- Google AI Studio (my compass in the sea of AI)
- AWS (my real estate in the cloud)

## 🛥️ Hobbies

- Boats! (The real kind – though I do appreciate a good Docker container)

## 🔒 About My Projects

Most of my work is private, so you won’t find many public repos here.  
Think of me as a code ninja: skills are visible, projects are stealthy!

## 🚫 Social Media

I don’t use social networks.  
I prefer sun, waves, winds, and code to likes and follows.

**Preferred style: Playful, always!**  
If you want to chat about boats, code, or AI, drop an anchor (issue or PR)!
